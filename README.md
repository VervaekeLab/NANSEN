# NANSEN - Neuro ANalysis Software ENsemble

A collection of apps and modules for processing, analysis and visualization of two-photon imaging data for the systems neuroscience community.


## Installation
Currently, the only actions that are needed is:
 1) Clone the repository and add all subfolders to MATLAB's search path. 
 2) Make sure the dependencies listed below are installed

Note: As more modules and toolboxes are added in the next weeks and months, these lists will get updated.

### Required Matlab toolboxes
 - Image Processing Toolbox
 - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
 - Parallel Computing Toolbox

To check if these toolboxes are already installed, use the `ver` command. Typing `ver` in matlab's command window will display all installed toolboxes. If any of the above toolboxes are not installed, they can be installed by navigating to MATLAB's Home tab and then selecting Add-Ons > Get Add-Ons

### Other toolboxes
 - GUI Layout Toolbox ([Go to toolbox site](https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/66235-widgets-toolbox-compatibility-support?s_tid=srchtitle))
 - Widgets Toolbox ([Go to toolbox site](https://se.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/66235-widgets-toolbox-compatibility-support?s_tid=srchtitle))

These toolboxes can also be installed using MATLAB's addon manager, but it is important to install a compatibility version of the Widgets Toolbox, so please use the link above.
